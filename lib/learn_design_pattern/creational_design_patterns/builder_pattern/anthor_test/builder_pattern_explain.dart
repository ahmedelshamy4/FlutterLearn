-> The Builder pattern lets you construct complex objects step by step.
 The Builder doesn’t allow other objects to access the product while it’s being built.

--> The important part is that you don’t need to call all of the steps.
 You can call only those steps that are necessary for producing a particular configuration of an object.
 #Director#
